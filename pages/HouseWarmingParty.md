# House Warming Party [Original 2014]

There comes a moment in every summariser’s life when the summariser has to face those about whom he has recently summarised with gay abandon. 

Such a moment arrived for this particular summariser last night.

From previous unpleasant experiences in similar situations, the Summariser had an inkling of the untold dangers that lurk and that could befall on his delicate heart - which by the way, in the anticipation of these dangers was violently moving about in his body, sometimes hitting the bottom of the stomach and at other times the top of his head, and in the remaining times wildly roaming about in the ribcage and other nooks and crannies.

It was then as the heart was making these frenzied motions, when the S. put a trembling step out of the Waitrose car park, the point A, from which he was planning to walk to Vishal & Mounika’s sparkling new flat, the point B. 
Mounika's brief Whatsapp message led S. to believe that it was a straightforward affair to walk from A to B. 
It would have been so, if one walked from point A to point B in a line that’s as close to a straight line as possible.

However, the line that S. tread with his wife and two children as the rain drops were falling on their heads, was, if anything, resembling more the contours of a jalebi made by an overenthusiastic chef, than a straight line. 
This line went around Waitrose 3 times, and then went along every building in the vicinity, making big dots near the entrances of each, as S. and family tried to decipher the buildings'name from the ultra small board that was hung near the entrances. 

After having done this for a while, and when his phone was in danger of getting drenched, the exasperated S. gave up and rang Mounika for more specific details, upon which Mounika playfully suggested concentrating on only the buildings surrounding a play area with a large slide. 
[The sympathetic reader may at this point say, why this crucial detail was not included in the earlier brief Whatsapp message - to which the S. has to nod in silent, but vigorous agreement.]

As the family was tottering about near the play area when S. found Chameli & Anand standing near the building and ringing the door bell. They turned towards S. and family and gave what a neutral observer would say was a neutral expression. 
But to S. it appeared like a cold stare, colder than the rain drops falling on his unconcealed head. 
After brief exchanges of not so effervescent greetings, the group together went up in the lift as S. was vainly hoping that the cold stare, and subsequent lack of effervescence was not a reaction to Chameli & Anand's portrayal in the previous summary - especially Chameli, who played an especially colourful part in the summary.

With these grim forebodings, S. entered the abode of Vishal and Mounika. Entering upon which, a breathtaking view of Canary Wharf, London along Thames, in its glittering bounty presented itself through the pristine windowpanes of the newly laid windows of the newly built apartment. 
This enthralling view suddenly transported S. and family and Chameli and Anand into a cheerful state of mind and the coldness felt earlier as they all were collectively getting drenched and thinking cold thoughts began to subside. 
Soon the usual effervesce returned. 
The night began its mirthful journey.

Vishal, the host, who was found, to the disconcertion of the S.'s sagacious readers, quite subdued, in the previous episode, returned to his characteristic bright and breezy self. 
Vishal in this mood, is known to laugh a laugh that transcends the pitiful laughs of mere mortals. 
It starts at the beginning of the night as one sees him, and then continues to ring throughout the night, may be going up a notch, once in a while, for a particularly funny joke, but on the whole maintains a considerable and continuous intensity, which may be ends only after one says bye to him for the night. 
Quite how he is able to manage to do this is a puzzle that S. is incapable of cracking. 
And as one is led to imagine, he did start that characteristic laugh as the goggle-eyed party entered.

Perspicuous readers might note Revati who was c. by a. in the previous episode. 
All S. could see then was that Revati was preoccupied with multi-coloured mehandi, which she took upon herself to smear on every unsuspecting kid that night, even the boisterous ones, and was also secretly eyeing for amenable adults. 
Seeing her in that voracious mood S. maintained a safe distance, lest he be smeared with the mehandi, which S. recognises is a pretty good thing to smear oneself with, as long as the oneself is not S. 
Last night's proceedings confirmed S.'s suspicion, and his decision to maintain distance during previous party was proved to be prudent.

This might leave the ever vigilant reader wondering quite what the proceedings were. 
S. is only too obliging to divulge. 
However, S. knows that after that happy divulging of interesting info, he will have to face Revati again. 
This puts S. in a somewhat precarious position. 
So, S. will have to tone down his enthusiasm and reveal only as much as is strictly required, and leave the vigilant reader to fill the gaps with his/her fertile imagination.

Chameli although back to her peppy self, was nevertheless maintaining a sense of reserve with a firm determination to appear in her best self in the latest summary. 
No sounds could be heard. 
However, S. has a keen hawk-eye, he couldn’t fail but to observe that Chameli sat as close to the serving table as it was possible without ordinary folks noticing what’s happening. 
But S. could see that copious amounts of finger food on the table was disappearing with dispatch, and made a smug note to self.

With that, S.’s energy levels reach to such low levels, that S. has to retire presently and put an end to the current summary. 
A lot has occurred last night that deserves to be in the summary, but may have to wait for another bout of inspiration. 
S. is also keenly aware that the reader, although sagacious and vigilant as mentioned previously, can also be a little impatient. 
For S., reader's comfort is paramount. So S. has to say tata for now.
