# The Apple Mac Store Episode

I still remember the day in 2013 when I gingerly walked into the Apple store. 
I was like that someone who was bewitched by the sirens in the Greek mythology, who was the chap, my memory escapes me, but you know who I mean. 
That bloke had his hands tied, and his crew had their ears blocked, but my limbs were free, and there was no cotton in my ears.  
I was pulled in as if an invisible force was directing me, and I went in, against my better judgement.
Once in, my jaw dropped, and it must have remained there for a good length of time - more than the duration a typical jaw would have remained.

I looked at the massive 27 inch iMac and grabbed it with both my hands, and held it tight against my bosom like a child holding its favorite toy. 
I must have dropped a joyful tear drop or two or more. 
Some noises resembling those emanating from wild animals may have even escaped my lungs. 
I couldn't believe this thing really existed.

It had all the angles and the curves that would melt the hardest of hearts. 
All the issues I had with my Macpro that I bought in 2008 - which episode will seem very similar to the current  one, but I won't bore you with that story now - had evaporated. 
All my reasons not to buy a Mac ever again melted away.
I held it tightly so no one could snatch it out of my hands.

When I was deeply immersed in this trance-like state - my mind filled with all happy thoughts - I heard a noise not very much unlike that which would proceed from a more than healthy, overfed mouse, when it finds itself in the presence of a large load of the choicest of its food supplies.

When I turned towards what sought my attention, I noticed a salesman standing right next to me - if I can say right next to me even when somebody stands so close to you with only a single layer of molecules separating them from you - smiling head to toe.

He asked me what I wanted.
I told him that exactly what I wanted.

He gently enquired again, did I really mean the 27 inch model when I said I want the 27 inch model.
Maybe my face looked to him as if it belonged to somebody who would want a 21 inch model and not the 27 inch model.
Or it may have been the undigested portion of the onion rings that I had before I entered the store which emanated odours from within that signalled to him that here is a man that wants a 21 inch model.

I'm afraid, I do not know.

In any case, I answered in the affirmative without so much as trace of irritation in my voice.

If I was in the usual not so sunny mood, I would have barked at him, why a man would say, or indeed woman, when you think of it, say, he, or she, or they, wanted a 27 inch model, if he, again, or she, or they, indeed, did not mean a 27 inch model?

Anybody with an ounce of grey matter in their bean would know they should ask for a 21 inch model if it is indeed 21 inch model that they desire.

In the present case, that I'm elaborating, I clearly mentioned I wanted 27 inch model, so 27 inch model it was that I actually wanted.

Just to clarify any confusion in the minds of my reader - it was the 27 inch model that I indeed wanted, and also asked for, and if the reader reads till the end would gather that it was 27 inch model that I indeed bought. 

He seemed satisfied for a moment, but again turned the dial on his smile a bit more and also raised his left eyebrow almost an imperceptible fraction of an inch and asked me incredulously, if incredulous is the word I want, and not incredible, why the deuce there are all these words that look the same, mean almost the same, but are not the same - if you see what I mean - we will never know. The English is a peculiar language, I can't go into that now, I don't want my reader to loose the track, or the plot depending on what the reader thinks the reader is reading. 

Now if the reader hasn't lost the track, or the plot, as the reader prefers, the reader would be wondering why the salesman ratcheted  up his smile quotient by a notch.
He was now endeavoring to the find out if I indeed meant all of the memory compartments to be maxed out.
That is, 4GB in each compartment, making a grand total of 16GB.
This wasn't unheard of, but it did raise eyebrows in 2013.
I was not in my usual mood, so I did not go through the why-the-man-or-indeed-the-woman- routine in my head.
Instead, I kept nodding like a lamb that had too much of the grass that had its roots soaked up in copious amounts of alcohol.

Now that his enquiries as regards memory were satisfied, I naively imagined he would precipitously loot my bank and allow me to leave with the adored object.
In this surmising I couldn't have been any farther from the truth.

Presently, the salesman smiled a bit more, which seemed impossible as I thought he smiled his widest previously, and there wasn't any more of space left in his face for his smile to spread, but spread it did, incredibly or was that incredulously? You see what I mean - damn difficult they make it. 
One has to be extremely cautious using these words. 
A syllable here or a syllable there that's not in the right place, and it means something else altogether different.

Now coming back on track to the salesman's enquiry.
He wanted confirmation that I indeed wanted a 4TB HDD and not 500GB HDD, or a 1TB HDD, as any other sane person he is probably accustomed to offer his custom wanted. 

I satisfied him yet again, by reaffirming what I had already stated to him in no uncertain terms previously, but now with a cheerfulness that could be only matched by the birds that leave their eggs when they are out to get food, and and on return find where there were eggs, are now little chicks, squeaking their tiny hearts out for their mothers they are seeing for the first time. 

Now all his curiosities satisfied, he proceeded at lightning speed to get me that iMac I wanted. 
And then, at an even faster pace, emptied everything there was in my bank account.

This normally would make me squirm internally, my soul being pulled and stretched into contorted shapes that souls are not accustomed to assume.
But on this occasion, with the sunny thoughts of being able to spend the rest of my life with this adored object filling every nerve cell in my brain, my soul didn't stir. 
It lay satisfied as the python that has swallowed more than its usual quota of lamb and doesn't look like it would think of food for a considerable duration of time.
