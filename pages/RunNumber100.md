# Run number 100 (Original 2014)

Today happened to be my run number 100 in straight 100 days. I still vividly remember the [run number 50](RunNumber50OnThe200thDay.md) . That day seems so much closer than day number 1, when it started. There weren't any dramatic incidents today : no van drivers in murderous mood, no alsatian dogs, no fit chinese runners. Neither was there any profound peace waiting to embrace me at the end of the run. Today's run was as ordinary as it could get. Maybe that was in fact the benefit of doing it consistently for hundred days, running 3 miles in the morning feels pedestrian !

Running everyday is not part of any challenge. My current #150DayChallenge is to write one post a day. That's where my focus is. Running has just been the benign side effect of my first #150DayChallenge. One of the reasons for doing my first challenge was to make exercising a habit, so it happens without me fussing too much about it. It had indeed become a habit, and I continued physical exercise in the form of running even after I finished the challenge.
