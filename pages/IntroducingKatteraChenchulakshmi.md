# Kattera Chenchulakshmi (Original 2014)

Kattera ChenchuLaxmi M.B.B.S, D.G.O didn't like what she heard on her phone. The nurse from her Maternity Hospital  called her, and asked her to come to the hospital urgently as one of her cases has gone into labour a week early. 

Kattera ChenchulLaxmi true to her name likes cutting up, and never leaves a chance to do a Cesarean whether it's required or not.  Although just 25 years old, she has delivered more than  30,000 babies in a span of 10 years, of which more than 28,000 were C-sections. She started very early by acting as an assistant since the age of 15 to her mother who was a M.B.B.S, D.G.O herself. In the true spirit of an enlightened mother, she had let young Kattera to conduct operations on her own as soon as she learnt the basics in a week. 

Kattera was a natural at cutting up, and this opportunity awakened a sleeping tiger in her. She went on a cutting spree for the next 10 years. Oh, and she also went to a medical college in between to get a couple of certificates, as they would look good framed, and placed on the side of her mothers. 

Her discomfort was not because she lost one of her cases to natural delivery, she does between 10 to 20 in a day, so losing one case is not such a big deal. She was actually planning an evening out with her new boyfriend. She was imagining how nice it would be to sit hand in hand with her boyfriend on one of the benches on Tank Bund. The intoxicating smell of hussain sagar, the enthralling roar of the traffic behind, the dark lake in front, spicy peanuts in the mouth, and a not so bad boyfriend sitting on the side. When this delightful mental image, a far cry from the violent world of Kattera Maternity Hospital,  was floating in her mind when her phone rang. 

And now she has to abandon her plans, or at least postpone,  and deliver baby number 30,001. She reluctantly got onto her red Maruti car and drove to the hospital and ran straight to the operation theatre as she heard shrieks of a female coming from there. Though a veteran of 30,000 deliveries, she also shrieked as soon as she entered and saw what looked like shining white teeth coming out of what generally should have been a head. But, a true professional, she quickly composed herself, and pulled the teeth out, and out came an especially dark blob of mass that was still attached to the womb with what looked like two umbilical cords. 

Having already weathered the shock of shining white teeth, Kattera took this in her stride, picked up  surgical scissors, placed the two cords in between the scissors, and was about to cut both when she saw that one of the umbilical cords was ending up at the wrong place on the baby. Suddenly she realized her mistake, and praying God that this is about all she can take in a day, and silently promising her that she won't buy cheap coconuts next time she visits her in Alivelu Manga Temple, she cut the right cord.

And so, Tangavelu Sombulingam Eliot, before he even became self-aware,  survived yet another attempt of a woman to not only shortchange him but cut him short for ever.
