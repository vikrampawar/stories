# An evening in 1992

Standing at the bus stop at Patny centre, Secunderabad, my eyes were on the busy jostling crowd falling over each other to get onto buses filled to the last inch.

The buses, mostly double-deckers, were moving slowly and surely, but unwillingly, like a pregnant woman as the passengers were latching onto any firm piece of the bus they could latch onto and hanging onto it. 

Some of the weaker people were giving up their struggle to get onto the bus, as the more energetic ones pushed them aside to make room for their foot on the platform of the bus. 

That was enough for them to slowly wriggle themselves into comfortable position as the bus moved on. 

But, my attention was not on the buses or on the crowd, or on the acrobatics of the energetic bullies, or even on the obnoxious smoke coming out of the buses, it was focused on how that day went, how that year went, and how the year before that went.

And also may be how the years since my father's death in 1984 went.

For sometime, I was rehashing the whole day, thinking how it could have been different. 

I could've got up a bit early. I could've taken a different bus. 
I knew, I couldn't trust the number 5 double-decker buses, they go so slowly. 
I knew that very well, I've taken that bus so many times to go to Mama's house in Secunderabad. 
I should've taken a different bus, or even taken an auto. 

May be, if I reached the exam hall in Wesley school on time, things would have been different.

I reached 15 minutes late to the most important exam I've ever taken. 
That meant I lost 15 precious minutes in a 3 hour test. 15 minutes! 

Luckily, it was the screening paper. Although, loosing 15 minutes meant that I couldn't finish the paper, may be, just may be, it may not matter.

Many seniors said that the score in the screening test doesn't count.
It's used only to pick the top 20,000 or so students, and only their main papers in Maths, Physics and Chemistry would even be looked at.
 
The professors were finding it difficult to correct the papers of all the 150,000 students every year. 
So, this screening test paper was introduced last year. Now, instead of three tests of three hours each, the IIT JEE aspirants will be taking 4 tests of 3 hours each.

Although I lost 15 minutes, and which meant I couldn't attempt the last 10 or so questions, I still attempted quite a few reasonably well. 
May be that's ok. 
But, I had no respite from the misgivings about the Chemistry paper. 
It was a nightmare.

My strategy during preparation, of leaving Inorganic Chemistry completely, Organic Chemistry partially, and concentrating only on the Physical Chemistry problems backfired. 
I didn't understand a single Physical Chemistry problem in the Chemistry question paper.

Sitting in the large and airy exam hall, picking my thick hair, I was wondering, if I ever studied this subject. 
Not a single question made any sense.

Half hour passed, I was scratching my head, and then an hour passed, I scratched some more. 
Then another hour passed, my scratching went to untenable intensity. 
Still, not a single problem was solved.

One, I just need one, oh God, just one glimpse of the solution to one problem, the ocean in my head would then settle, and my mind would start working again.

And when all hope was lost, and only 30 more minutes were left, and I was totally drenched in my sweat, one sliver of a solution to a part of a physical chemistry problem appeared in the head, and that relieved my pressure and my mind started working again. 

But, I had only 29 more minutes left. 
I went at a furious pace at that problem, and then the next, and so on for every single minute of those 29 minutes, writing constantly with my head down, until the last minute as the examiner angrily snatched the paper from my unwilling hands, and tearing a bit of it in the process.

May be, he was the same man who gave me the strange looks in the morning as I entered 15 minutes late to the first test.
