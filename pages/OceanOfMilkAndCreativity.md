# Ocean of milk (Kshirasagara) and creativity (Original 2014)

I sometimes wonder how and why some of the mythological stories survived innumerable generations to reach us. 

Maybe because they are abstract and at the same time visually powerful. 

It is possible for everybody to come up with their own interpretation and make it their own. 

I enjoy figuring out if the stories have any ideas of practical significance.

The churning of Ocean of milk (Kshirasagara madhanam) is one such alluring mythological story with a down to earth idea.

For those who don't know, in this story Devas (Gods) and Asuras (Demons) get together to churn the Ocean of milk using a Mountain as a pole resting on a large tortoise. 
As if this is not enough, they use a large Serpent King as their churning string. (It's breathtakingly stunning imagination - one day, Bollywood may show this on screen)

Their aim is to get to Amrita ( Nectar of immortal life). 

But, as they do this, a ragtag of things come out. The most destructive of which is Halahala (poison). 

Luckily they get Lord Shiva to gobble it up so it doesn't cause any concern. 

Eventually they get to Amrita and as you can imagine Devas find a way to take it all leaving the Asuras with 'Babaji ka tullu'.

This conveys to me the idea of 'Creativity'. 

Embarking on a new creative venture is a bit like 'Kshirasagara Mathanam'. 

Everybodys' eyes are on the Amrita and they all struggle whipping oceans with mountains and serpents. 

They eventually get it, but they also get a ragtag of things along with destructive Halahalas.

Keep going ...
