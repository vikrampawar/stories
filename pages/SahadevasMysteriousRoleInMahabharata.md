# Sahadeva's mysterious role in Mahabharata (Original 2014)


When I was in year 3, I had a precocious Brahmin boy called Hari as my best friend. 

We would talk to each other for hours on end. 

Even at such a tender age he had remarkable story telling abilities. 
He would tell me mythological stories that his grand parents told him and I'd listen with my mouth wide open. 

I remember him telling me a story about Nakula and Sahadeva, that stuck in my young mind because of the grossness of the story. 

Later on, after several runs in my adult mind, I find the story fascinating still for entirely different reasons.

To put the little story in the bigger context, Mahabharata is a story of five illustrious brothers and their rivalry with cousins that start as minor tiffs in the childhood and grow with age with dubious help of Lord Krishna to take on the epic proportions of Kurukshetra which at one end leads to the shameful killing of cousins, but at the other end also leads to the composition of Bhagavad Gita - the book encoding timeless principles.

The little story I alluded to earlier relates to one of Nakula and Sahadeva (don't recollect who, I'll pick Sahadeva). 

While the eldest Dharmaraj is known for his righteousness, the next Bhima for his strength, and the next Arjuna for his skills, Nakula and Sahadeva are relative unknowns and hardly anybody knows anything about them except that they make up the magical number of five and are equals parts husbands of Draupadi.

Now, in this little story Hari told me, the father of these five brothers Pandu tell's his sons on his death bed to not burn him on pyre as is the custom, but to eat him (9 year old mind got instantly engaged!). 

After some refusals to accede to his request and his subsequent insistence, they agree. 

And when he eventually dies, the brothers agree that it is gross to eat their own father's dead body and they decide to light him up instead.

So, the elder brothers ask Sahadeva to keep an eye on the dead body, and they all go into the forest to fetch some wood. 

All alone, Sahadeva, thinks about his dad's death wish, and feeling sorry for him, decides to take a bite. 

Just then, a fox enters and tries to disturb him and put him off from eating. 

Anyhow, he manages to eat the dead man's toe and as soon as he eats it, he instantly recognizes the fox as Lord Krishna, and he also instantly becomes aware of Lord Krishna's cunning plans that will lead to Kurukshetra.

The fox turns into Lord Krishna and he tells Sahadeva, you've eaten your fathers toe and have become as powerful as me, you know everything that's happened, that's happening and that will happen. 
But, this knowledge is useless. 

The moment you reveal this knowledge to others in anyway or use this knowledge to change the future, your head will break into thousand pieces (In Telugu - 'Nee tala veyyi chekkalavvu gaka'). 

Sahadeva feeling helpless that he is going to be unwilling participant of Kurukshetra curses Lord Krishna that if anything happens to any of his family of five brothers, Lord Krishna's head will break into thousand pieces. 

So, Lord Krishna has no option but to protect each member of the family throughout Mahabharata.

Although fascinating to a nine year old mind because of the gory details, to an adult mind, this story tells of the importance of every single individual. 

We may not be a Dharmaraj, Bhima or an Arjuna, but we are still equally powerful in our own individual way - we just have to realize it.
