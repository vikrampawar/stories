# Rajendra Prasad and one outrageous and endearing movie

A recollection of this outrageous but endearing movie. Don't remember the name.

In this movie, Rajendra Prasad falls madly in love with a large-eyed hot- headed beauty. 
He tries in vain to woo her in many ways, and after finally being sternly rejected by her, he becomes dejected and then disappears.

He reappears after a few years, a completely changed man. 
There is a dramatic difference in his demeanour. 
Gone is the man with chirpy attitude and frivolous jokes, replaced with a calm and collected man with an ever smiling face. 
People say in hushed whispers that he's gone to the himalayas and has now got amazing super-natural powers.

He remains in the vicinity of his love, the heroine, but doesn't do anything to woo her. 
One day, she is chased by the street rowdies and when she is desperately looking for someone to help her, he enters. 
He then without moving a muscle sends each one of them packing. 
He uses some of his newfound powers without the heroine noticing. 

To invoke his powers he recites the same mantra throughout the movie - 'If my love towards my beloved is true, let this happen'.

There are many such scenes where he uses his powers to get the heroine out of trouble. 

Although she no longer acts sternly with him as before, she doesn't soften her stand against him either.

I don't remember how, but in one such incident his hand is chopped off, and the heroine comes running to him all worried. 

He continues in his calm and collected manner and tells her, 'Don't worry, If my love towards you is true, this hand will grow'. 

Lo and behold, his hand starts growing right in front of the heroine's horrified eyes. 

The heroine begins to get increasingly terrified as the hand grows, and finally with a renewed disgust shouts at him, saying that he's a magician and a trickster and is doing all this to gain her attention. She says she'll remain unmarried all her life but will never get close to him.

Dejected yet again, he says to himself, if my love rejects me because of these newfound powers, I don't have any use for these. He then says 'If my love towards my beloved is true, I'll loose all my powers', and loses his powers. Right then, as it happens in all movies, villains of all kinds take this golden opportunity and make his life a living hell.

Perhaps when he reaches the utmost of his sanity, the heroine accepts him and they somehow wriggle out of the situation to give a happy ending to the movie.

Now, you don't have to bite your nails, move to the edge of your seats or do whatever it is you do in these situations.
