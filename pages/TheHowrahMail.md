# The Howrah Mail (Original 2014)

Every morning at 6.40 a.m., the Howrah mail wakes up from its deep slumber, gives a long hoot and starts its unsteady steps sluggishly - it seems to be a distant relative of the [double-decker](TheDoubleDeckerBus.md) buses in Secunderabad - and then moves in several fits and starts, from the Nampally station, as if, it doesn't want to separate its passengers from the hoards of their family members on the platform, especially the mothers and sisters who are on the verge of crying, but who, because of the train's uncertain temperament are in a confusion as to when to start or stop crying. 

And then, when it's finally decided that all the mothers and sisters have cried enough, and are at a far enough distance to be seen clearly, it picks up a gentle pace and goes tukum tukum for a day and a half, and reaches the world's longest platform, one of the two claims to fame for Kharagpur, by around 2.30 p.m in the afternoon.
