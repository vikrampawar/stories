# Introducing Endagal Barasu [ original 2014]

Takkaram was entering into this cabin one morning, his ears perked as he heard something that sounded like "Dumga daraga dardesi, sat da diba oeeeeeeee" and as he was wondering where this sweet voice was coming from, he saw Endagal Barasu, the team leader, emerging out of the cabin with his eyes half-closed, one hand on his ear, and the other hand outstretched.

Takkaram said, "That sounds sweet Endagal, also a bit familiar, but I can't make out what it is, what are you singing?"

Endagal's eyes opened and his face broke into a shy smile and he said, looking up as he is a short man, "Nothing ya, song, TV, all day playing. All day. Good song ya. Very good song. Very very good song. Altaf Raja.", and then contorted his face, put his forefinger to his thumb and wiggled his fingers showing how much he appreciated the song.

"Oh, you mean 'Tum tho tehre pardesi saath kya nibhavoge'..?", Takkaram said.

"He..He..He.. Ya, ya, ya, that only man. He..He..He", his face lighting up as Takkaram recognised his song.

"That's why the tune sounded familiar. But, Endagal, I couldn't make out a single word of what you were singing!!"

His face turning a bit red , he said, "He..He..He.. Whattodoya. Me, no Hindi. Only English. Only English He..He..He"

Suppressing his laughter, Takkaram said "O.K. Looks like you were going out, catch you later."

"Nothing ya. Smoking ya.", saying this, Endagal went out to the front of the office where smokers usually gathered to smoke.

Takkaram went inside excitedly to see if his other colleagues have arrived. They all had just arrived and were settling down. Takkram's eyes met theirs, and they started laughing.
