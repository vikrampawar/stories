Summary: 

There was a memorable moment when PD flew like a hawk and balanced on the net for a few seconds - unfortunately the point was not saved.

Hanu devised a clever plan to maintain his moral while playing - he got his subordinates to cheer for him. I was worried if they will begin to dance like cheer leaders - luckily for us they didn't :).. 

GS was in his usual devastating form. We should all probably vote for and force him to play with left hand ( or on second thoughts may be not - if we can't win against him even then, it'll be unbearable :) )

I was going to but in the end decided not to mention anything about Telugu vs Kannada match.

Kalaripayattu's eyes lighted up when he saw a high flying net shot, he jumped up in the air, his body curled up into a ball, then he uncurled his body, expanded his shoulders and smashed wildly in the air, the time stood still for a second, and then it happened - his racquet missed the cock and his team the point.

Non-playing team members were missed.
