# Badminton Match (Original 2012)


## 25 sep

```markdown
21 17 gs pd vs sat YS
13 21 vp pd vs gs YS
13 21 vp sat vs pd gs
21 19 gs sat vs sivanand pavan
21 19 gs pd vs vp sat
21 15 gs sat vs vp YS

```


Summary: 

There was a memorable moment when PD flew like a hawk and balanced on the net for a few seconds - unfortunately the point was not saved.

YS devised a clever plan to maintain his moral while playing - he got his subordinates to cheer for him. I was worried if they will begin to dance like cheer leaders - luckily for us they didn't :).. 

GS was in his usual devastating form. We should all probably vote for and force him to play with left hand ( or on second thoughts may be not - if we can't win against him even then, it'll be unbearable :) )

I was going to but in the end decided not to mention anything about Telugu vs Kannada match.

Kalaripayattu was sorely missed.

Non-playing team members were missed even more.

Baddy Highlights :

TB executed an unusual dance move in center of the court and came down with his legs twisted into a V shape - point was lost.

And when he was not dancing, his shrieks were shaking his partners.

GS spared us a few games.

PD was busy on his BB while he was out of court and thinking about something while inside the court.

```markdown
21 -15. gs ss vs sy vp
```

Inspired underdogs sy and vp almost gave a scare, but gs and ss sailled through in the end.

```mardown
21 12 Gs ss vs pd pm
21 13 pm ys vs vp pd
21 13 vp ss vs gs ys
21 13 vp pd vs gs pm
21 19 vp pd vs ss pm
```

After being beaten thoroughly by underrated ys pm, vp pd went on a winning spree. Some seriously doubt match fixing or may be gs's mind was already in India.

Highlights :

Kalaripayattu's eyes lighted up when he saw a high flying net shot, he jumped up in the air, his body curled up into a ball, then he uncurled his body, expanded his shoulders and smashed wildly in the air, the time stood still for a second, and then it happened - his racquet missed the cock and his team the point.
