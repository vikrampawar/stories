# Running a mile under 4 minutes - Realms of possibilities

Whenever we are consciously planning our future, whether it's professional or personal, whether it's grand or trivial, we are always working within the bounds of realm of possibilities. Again, this is a loaded concept and it acts at several dimensions. For it to be practical and useful, many examples will be required to convey the intended meaning.

I'll take an example from the field of athletics first. Before that, let me take you back to 200,000 years when the first modern human, the caveman, who's anatomically similar to us appeared on the surface of the earth.  This caveman may appear a lot different to us, but one thing we could be in no doubt of, is that this cave man could run very much like we do. So, if say that it took nearly 200,000 years for man to realize that he could run a mile in under four minutes only after Roger Bannister achieved the feat on the 6th of May, 1954, in 3 min 59.4 sec, I am not not going too far from the truth. Once the realization dawned, man after man ran a mile under four minutes. Many have done so for over 100 times in their career. It was as if they waited for some signal to say that it's possible.

At least in running, which is as natural as it can get, there was nothing stopping every man that was ever born to achieve this feat, and yet not a single one did until that day. That is the hold of 'Realm of possibilities'. We are incapable of considering anything that's not deemed to be in it. 

Unfortunately, it's not something that's limiting only world-class athletes. It affects each one of us individually, and we routinely discard all possibilities of growth because it doesn't fall in our RoP. We let our environments that we fall into, to decide, or to make a framework of RoP.  If, unfortunately again, our limited talents and initiative are not the right fit for the RoP, then we struggle throughout life - we choose what to study, where to work, where to live, how to spend time, entirely on this limited RoP.
