# Carrom match (Original 2012)

I'm happy to announce that we had our first carrom board match yesterday (22/09/2012 Sat).

Scores

GS & SY bt BJ & VP    29-14

The match was closely contested. 
The scores don't justify the tension, the drama and the edge of the seat entertainment it provided to the audience. 
The tension was so intense that SY at one point pocketed the opposition coin and gave 6 points away.

Match began with initial doubts over the condition of the carrom board surface. 

International players GS and SY were concerned that they will not be able employ their repertoire of delicate shots and fine cuts. 

The officially recommended 'boric acid powered' wasn't available. 
The alternative 'Johnson's baby powder' supplied wasn't up to the mark. 

It was suggested that Ponds or any talcum powder would be a better alternative. 

After a few frantic calls, it became clear that talcum powder was also not available in Weavers  Court.  

Then a brilliant and innovative idea came from the audience -  Maida could be used. 
Just in case, you think it is a joke, the players actually applied Maida to a section of the carrom board to test the theory. 

Luckily for the carrom board, the idea was abandoned.  However, all this commotion only made the event more enjoyable. 

Thanks for all those who participated. For those who did not, don't worry, there will be more matches in the future :)
