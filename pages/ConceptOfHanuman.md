# Concept of Hanuman (Original 2014)

I like to figure out some hidden meaning behind the mythological stories. Figuring  out the most intriguing of the numerous Gods worshipped in the Hindu religion is an extension. 

Being an Ape-God, Hanuman is definitely among the top of my list - [Han-man is more powerful than Super-man, Spider-man, and Bat-man combined. ooo-ha-ha-ha, ooo-ha-ha-ha, ooo-ha-ha-ha (don't be alarmed it's just a vikruta laugh or villainous laugh common in South-Indian movies)]. We get to know a lot of this God through some interesting tales.

One of them is from the time Hanuman was a baby. More curious than the normal babies, baby Hanuman saw the big red sun and was intent on finding out what it is. So, he jumped up to the sun and grabbed it in one hand. It looked so red, so he assumed it must be an apple and gobbled it up and came back to the earth innocently. Of course, everybody on earth and the heaven were first mystified, and then horrified that sun is nowhere to be seen.

So, they all, as is the custom, go to the superior Gods - one of Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma - to register their complaint. The superior God, again, as is the custom, tries to solve it for them. In this case, He just says go to Anjani as her son Hanuman is the culprit. 

This troubled group then goes to Anjani with the same complaint. Anjani as a true Indian mother denies that her innocent baby would do anything as horrible as dematerializing the sun. But in the meantime, baby Hanuman finding it difficult to digest the sun, ejects it from his bottom. The sun bouncing of the earth several times, but happy and relieved to be released, goes back to his usual position. The group also relieved, go back to their abode equally happy. 

The distressed sun caused enough damage while coming out, so that Hanuman, and therefore every monkey thenceforth, has had a ripe red rump.
