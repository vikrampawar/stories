# Concept of Hanuman (Original 2014)

I like to figure out some hidden meaning behind the mythological stories. Figuring  out the most intriguing of the numerous Gods worshipped in the Hindu religion is an extension. 

Being an Ape-God, Hanuman is definitely among the top of my list - [Han-man is more powerful than Super-man, Spider-man, and Bat-man combined. ooo-ha-ha-ha, ooo-ha-ha-ha, ooo-ha-ha-ha (don't be alarmed it's just a vikruta laugh or villainous laugh common in South-Indian movies)]. We get to know a lot of this God through some interesting tales.

One of them is from the time Hanuman was a baby. More curious than the normal babies, baby Hanuman saw the big red sun and was intent on finding out what it is. So, he jumped up to the sun and grabbed it in one hand. It looked so red, so he assumed it must be an apple and gobbled it up and came back to the earth innocently. Of course, everybody on earth and the heaven were first mystified, and then horrified that sun is nowhere to be seen.

So, they all, as is the custom, go to the superior Gods - one of Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma - to register their complaint. The superior God, again, as is the custom, tries to solve it for them. In this case, He just says go to Anjani as her son Hanuman is the culprit. 

This troubled group then goes to Anjani with the same complaint. Anjani as a true Indian mother denies that her innocent baby would do anything as horrible as dematerializing the sun. But in the meantime, baby Hanuman finding it difficult to digest the sun, ejects it from his bottom. The sun bouncing of the earth several times, but happy and relieved to be released, goes back to his usual position. The group also relieved, go back to their abode equally happy. 

The distressed sun caused enough damage while coming out, so that Hanuman, and therefore every monkey thenceforth, has had a ripe red rump. 


But, I haven't yet completely described Hanuman's concept - he needs to be revealed a bit more. 

For that, we go to Ramayana the epic Indian tale. Towards the end of this mega saga, the hero Rama reaches Lanka,  the abode of the villain Ravana, along with his brother Laxmana, his fan Hanuman, and his Vanara Sainya (Monkey army). 

The battle begins and Rama and his army kill one general after another of Ravana and cause huge damages to Ravana's army. On the verge of panic, Ravana sends his dear son, the talented Indrajit (jittulamari), who, in addition to supreme fighting skills, possessed mesmerizing magical powers. Indrajit with his phenomenal magical powers subdues the whole of Rama army, and assaults Laxmana, hero's brother, with his most powerful weapon - Shakti. Laxmana falls to the ground unconscious. The Sun sets signalling the end of the battle for that day, and the whole of Rama's army carries Laxmana to their camp dejected. 

The wise men in the camp discuss how to revive Laxmana and decide that he needs to be given Sanjivani - a rare herb with life-giving properties. It had to be given soon. This herb grows on a distant mountain, Dronagiri, surrounded by treacherous forest. There wasn't enough time to go to the mountain by foot, or on horse. The only option was to jump to the mountain. The entire monkey army then starts chattering to decide who should do the jump. One would expect Hanuman to come forward at this point and offer to jump. However, he didn't. He wasn't sure of his own ability to jump that far. Everybody else then persuades Hanuman, reminding him of his earlier magnificent feats; how he jumped to the Sun and gobbled him up when he was a child ; how he jumped to Lanka to deliver Rama's message to Sita, as she was held captive by Ravana. 

After a lot of persuasion, Hanuman, shouting  'Rama, Rama, Rama', leaps up into the air and to his own surprise, and everybody else's eventual delight, reaches mount Dronagiri effortlessly. Significantly, he cannot figure out where Sanjeevani is among the numerous herbs, plants and shurbs on the mountain[ Aside - This reveals one more aspect of Hanuman of being pure muscle]. So he simply lifts the whole mountain in the palm and leaps back to Rama's army camp. The wise men quickly pick the herb and administer it to Laxmana, who instantly and miraculously springs back to life.
