# Parking Car (Original Apr 2019)

Today I noticed something amusing.
Anand was ahead of me when we drove the car to the car park.
When we got to the ticket dispenser, I noticed that Anand didn't come out of his car.
Instead, I saw him float up from his seat like a spider and smoothly shift himself to the passenger side.
Then, his hand came of the window like the tentacle of an octopus and tapped a card on the machine.
The movement was so smooth and elegant, it seemed natural.
I wondered why it never occurred me that we could move to the passenger seat.
Why I worried that I have to hop out of the car, tap the card, and hop back into the car immediately before the barrier shuts down.

When Anand's car moved out, I moved to the ticket machine.
I tried to imitate Anand and do what I thought I had seen him do.
Seeing was one thing, doing it was completely another.
Leave alone doing it smoothly, I could not lift myself and shift aside no matter what I did.
After a few anxious moments of trying this, I decided that it's not up to me to do it.
Anand had some special talent for this spider-like movement that's essential to repeat his performance.
I did the next best thing.
I came out of the car, tapped on the machine and ran back exactly as I feared I may have to do.
But there's usually enough time to do thing clumsy maneuver. 
So it was okay for me in the end.
