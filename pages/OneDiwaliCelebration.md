# One Diwali Celebration

Summary:

The summarizer does not take any responsibility whatsoever for the veracity of the summary. In his inebriated state, his imagination is known to run wild.

- There was a general apprehension among those present while lighting rockets that Angabaru might fly off along with the rocket. So a helpful suggestion was made to carry one more rocket in the other hand - the hope was that if one took him up, the other will bring him down. On second thoughts, the suggestion may not have been foolproof. But, to the relief of all and Bhadramala in particular, Angabaru stayed firmly on the ground.

- Chameli produced a variety of sounds to animate her talks - they spanned a wide spectrum starting from tat-tat-tat, touching phat-phat-phat and reaching up to dhaaaaaaaam. [The summarizer was in two minds, and in some internal turmoil,  in deciding whether or not to clarify where the sounds emanated from. In the end, he has decided to be discrete about it]

- In the midst of his punchy one-liners Mani was seen keeping some score that seemed to have some grave significance, but it escaped the summarizer. On another note, Mani managed to confuse everybody about his origins. The summarizer is still unsure whether Mani is a Bengali, a Tamilian, a Maharashtrian or a Punjabi.

- As Chameli was playfully recounting incidents with Anand (with the above mentioned sounds interjected), Anand sometimes uttered loud and vehement 'No's. Just as one thought that Anand has broken the record of saying the most vehement 'No' with the highest decibel rating, he produced one even more vehementer 'No' with a decibel rating outdoing the previous one. He kept doing that for most of the evening.

- Parikrama was efficiency herself. She was running in and out of the Kitchen bringing the food plates for the general delight of all with a speed that would have left P.T. Usha gasping for her breath. As the bewildered summarizer found once to his utter amazement, she was equally fast in snatching a plate out of the hand, if the plate was empty or the hand idle for more than a nano-second. Luckily, the summarizer learned his lesson quickly enough to ensure that his plate never again remained empty, and his hand idle, until his stomach was filled to the brim.

- Mrs Manivara took a page from Chameli as she described the sounds that came out of the gear-box of her car. She then went onto to recount some really funny incidents.

- By the time Mr Manivara made a dramatic entry, the hearts of those present was palpitating with excitement after listening to Mrs Manivara's stories about Mr Manivara. Anticipational fever was running so high that many imagined that it's just a matter of a few seconds before Mr Manivara would rip off his shirt to show the six-packs he has been carefully building, if not that, he would at least do a Michael Jackson moonwalk for the general appeasement of all. However, fortunately for the kids, Mr Manivara wasn't in any mood for such antics, and the kids were saved from the untold horrors they would have been subjected to if the scenario envisaged had played out.

- Mounika who had hitherto only shown her calmer self, showed what she was capable of when excited, as the firing of crackers was coming to an end. Vishal who was generally voluble seemed to be in a contemplative mood - maybe there was something in the chicken or the samosas that produced this unusual mood in him.

- Dhanish came downstairs briefly after watching Harry Potter movie with Saurashoora two times back-to-back. His expression seemed to suggest that that was not enough. And rightly so, instantly he ran back upstairs for the third installment of the movie.

- Saurashoora felt pretty fortified with the presence of so many uncles and aunts, so there was a marked letting down of his inhibitions. 

- Anamika found the blinking light so amusing that she was running towards it and dancing in its front at every chance.

- Parikrama's daughter showed her talents in making a pretty delightful caricature of Mani.
