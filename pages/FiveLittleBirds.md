# Five little birds, one daring feat [Original 2014]

A bird is perched on top of a vertigo-inducing thin steep 400 feet high column of rock in the middle of a valley filled with such rocks. It's just hatched five little birds. Its partner restless, glides down from the top. In a few minutes the mother bird also glides down and reaches the ground beneath. It looks up towards its babies and cries out loud as if it's beckoning them to come down.

One cute fluffy little bird barely able to walk, moves its little legs, comes to the tip of the rock, giving one long innocent look to its mother, does an incredible leap. As it comes down, it tries to stretch its unformed wings, and as one's wondering if it's going to fly or gain control of the fall, it does neither and it hits a rock, causing one to cringe, and then it hits another, and then one more, and reaches the ground and lies motionless.

As one's wondering what's going on, another little bird moves forward, looks at its mother and jumps exactly as the first one. This one also spreads its non-wings, seems to fall gracefully for a second, and then hits a rock, deviates from its course, hits another rock, and then one more, till it reaches the ground motionless.

While one is stilling cringing, one more bird starts its slow steps and does the same jump, this one accidentally pulling another bird which unfortunately wasn't yet prepared to jump. The two birds start their descent down looking like a couple of paratroopers, until one, to the horror of the observer, hits a rock, and then another also hits a rock, both tumbling in the rocks and falling to the ground. One of them reaches the parents, but still not stable, goes down even further, as the helpless mother follows it down.

As if this was not enough, the fifth bird also jumps. This one's jump is a lot more cleaner, and it comes a long distance down without hitting any rock and raising the hopes of the observer, but it hits a rock as well, does the now familiar tumble among the rocks and reaches ground motionless.

What's happening? Why are these cute little birds, barely a day old, doing these fatal jumps from these incredible heights ? Why are its parents looking helplessly or have even provoked these little birds to do these incredible jumps? What's the purpose?
