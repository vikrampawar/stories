# Run Milestones in Cricket (Original 2014)

In cricket, 50 runs is a decent milestone and all batsmen routinely make 50, so it doesn't feel like an achievement worth celebrating. 

You can see most batsmen raise their bats reluctantly towards the pavilion after reaching 50 - as if they are ashamed to show that they are jubilant. 

Similarly, I find doing something for 50 days straight, a decent milestone, but not worth celebrating. 

The activity may turn into habit, but as life changes, so does the habit, and it is lost.

But 100 runs is a significant milestone for a batsmen. 

So much so that almost all batsmen become very nervous in the nineties (even Sachin Tendulkar) and sometimes throw their wicket away doing silly stuff. 

Equally, a lot of batsmen get out immediately after making a 100, doing silly stuff again, but for a different reason.

They feel so relieved after reaching the milestone that they lose concentration and get out. 

This maybe justifies their elation on reaching a 100, and subsequent exuberance and frenetic prancing about and general abandon in pointing their bats at the pavilion.

Although there wasn't any pavilion to make faces at, I did go through similar emotions on reaching 100. 

Knowing well how most batsmen get out immediately after 100, I waited until the 111th day to share my experience with a select group of friends. 

This is when the stakes got higher, and I felt the world was watching. 

The next milestone of 150 became much harder than it ever is for a batsmen in cricket. But I did cross 150 with this added pressure, and when I went past 150, I felt convinced that I moved into a different territory.

200 is surprisingly, as far as I can remember, not such a torturous milestone for batsmen, except may be for some odd but adorable batsmen like Mohammad Azharuddin.
