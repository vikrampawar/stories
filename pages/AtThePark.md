# At the park

The sun has been toying with the idea of closing its business for the day.
Having fried the city the whole day, it's now stretching its legs in preparation and has relaxed a bit.

At this time of the day, Dassamia park is full of people.

When I say people, it's mostly couples strewn all around the park.
One would be amazed to see how innovative the positions are that these couples find to sit in the park.
Hands and legs intermingled, making it hard to see where one ends and the other begins.
The one objective seems to be that no air should pass between the couple.
All of the couples seem to be be intent on this idea,

The keener of the eye would see that there is one couple sitting in the park that seems to be violating this rule.
They've sat so far apart that it is a borderline case to say that they've sat together.
If fact, if one of them turned their faces away, you may think that they are not together.

A local that's conversant with the skills of the auto rickshaw drivers in that place would think it a matter of course for one to go through them.
And if Dassamia park keepers were any less fearsome, we'd have in fact seen at least some of them going between them by now.

As we said the sun has relaxed and the wind is working its magic.
One would say the odours hitting the nostrils is divine, just if they are willing to ignore the fact that it could also be called bovine.
A fresh dump of cow dung is also making its presence felt along with all the others smells permeating the place.
If fact, those that are keen accumulators of the knowledge about the bovine excreta would say that it was delivered not so long ago.
It still retained the sweetness that's characteristic of the dump that's fresh and not yet been caked by the careless park walkers.

That is to say that it's as pleasant as it could be in mid may evening in Dyrabad.
