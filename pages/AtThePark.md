# At the park

The sun has been toying with the idea of closing its business for the day.
Having fried the city the whole day, it's now stretching its legs in preparation and has relaxed a bit.

At this time of the day, usually Dassamia park is full of people.

When I say people, it's mostly couples strewn all around the park.
One would be amazed to see how innovative the positions are that these couples find to sit in the park.
Hands and legs intertwined, making it hard to see where one ends and the other begins.
The one objective seems to be that no air should pass between the couple.
All of the couples seem to be be intent on this idea.

The keener of the eye would see that there is one couple sitting in the park that seems to be violating this rule.
They've sat so far apart that it is a borderline case to say that they've sat together.
If fact, if one of them turned their faces away, you may think that they are not together.

A local that's conversant with the skills of the auto rickshaw drivers in that place would think it a matter of course for one to swerve the auto through the gap.
And if Dassamia park keepers were any less fearsome, we'd have in fact seen at least some of them going between them by now.

As we said the sun has relaxed and the wind is working its magic.
One would say the odours hitting the nostrils are divine, provided they are willing to discount one of them which has bovine origins, as a fresh dump of cow dung is also making its presence felt along with all the others smells permeating the place.

If fact, those that are keen accumulators of the knowledge about the bovine excreta would say that it was delivered not so long ago.
It still retained the sweetness that's characteristic of the dump that's fresh and not yet been caked by the careless park walkers.

That is to say that it's as pleasant as it could be in mid may evening in Dyrabad.

But anybody looking at Takkarram Kirrakke and Andagamma Adaragottu sitting so far apart would know that they are both impervious to these pleasant surroundings.

It's not just the author and the reader that are keenly aware of this couple.
There's one little blighter who has been following them even more closely than us.

The locals call him Chikka.
It's hard to say how old he is.
Certainly below 15.
Is he above 10? As I said, it's hard to know.
It's also very difficult to know where he comes from, where he lives, whether he has any family.

All we know is that he has a shrewd business sense that'll make Babbani, the local billionaire business magnet, proud, if he possessed that knowledge at that tender age.

He is carrying a little basket that has various kinds of dry snacks, the chief among them being spicy peanuts.

If Takkarram were in any normal situation, he would have seen that Chikka has been hiding behind the little grass mound that's freshly developed on his right side.

The reader might be wondering where this grass mound has come from.
It's come from the barren patch in front of Takkarram.
Lest the reader attributes the barren patch to the carelessness of the aforementioned park keepers, who are, in addition to being fearsome, are excellent keepers of the grass in Dassamia park. If they had any inkling that this patch was freshly created in the such a short span of time they would descend upon the culprits with their legendary ferocity.

The patch wasn't there when Takkarram and Andagamma arrived a few minutes earlier.
It's formed because Takkarram has been picking one strand at a time from that spot and putting it on his right side.
He has been doing this since he arrived.

The rate of destruction would make the destroyers of the Brazilian Amazon forest proud. 

The reason for this grass-picking is that Andagamma has been annoyed at him.
She has been giving him fearsome looks, one would say the park keepers, if they got wind of it, would come to take notes in the hope of improving their already considerable expertise in this area.

When Andagamma is in this mood and giving him looks, she reminds Takkarram of the extraordinarily fearsome goddess whose poster Takkarram has grown up seeing everyday.

God knows how this goddess looks in real life, but the portrayal of this particular deity by the poster makers is literally breathtaking.
It would be really interesting to see the reaction of this goddess if she were to descend down to earth and see her fantastical portrayals.
Unfortunately that may not be possible any time soon.

It makes one wonder, what would be the inspiration for these poster makers? What makes their imagination so fertile.

One, who is not partial to these poster makers could imagine that these children of this exotic artform must be male.
This must be their way of letting out something that's happening in their lives without actually saying it directly.

However, I think we are digressing.

In the meantime, Takkarram having settled his blood flow with the grass picking exercise, picked up courage to utter a word.

He said 'Anda'.

He heard 'Huu', which was not really what Andagamma said. It was just Andagamma's way of acknowledging and not acknowledging at the same time what she has heard. This was the sound produced from her letting out a jet of air through her nostrils. If we have not seen it, we'd not believe those fine delicate nostrils could take this force of air and still remain so fine and delicate.

The courage that Takkarram mustered, evaporated.

He picked some more grass and tried again.

'Anda'.

'Huu'.

More grass.

'Anda'.

'Huu'.

'Anda'.

The last 'Anda' did not come from Takkarram because he has not picked up more grass yet. 
So he came out of his present state in a jerk.
He looked around to see where the last 'Anda' emanated from.
It seemed to be from beyond the grass mound on his right.
He wondered where it came from, as he was not aware of his own phenomenal creation.
He dispersed the grass curious to see the source.
There looking at him intently, he found Chikka.

'Who are you? Why did you say "Anda"'? asked Takkarram impatiently.

'Sir, I wanted to help you'.

'Whaaat !!??... What do you mean help, what help?'. One could sense a bit of irriation in his voice. Here he was trying to woo his beloved - one would imagine, as in the present case, it looks quite untenable proposition -  and this little blot on the landscape coming in his way putting spanner in the works.

'Sir, I noticed you were having trouble calling mam. I've been watching you for a while and guessed that you were going to pick up more grass before calling mam. I thought I'll speed up the process and also save some grass, I was getting drowned in it. I don't think you'd like facing the park keeper after what you've done.', looking the mass of grass from which he emerged.

At which point, lot of questions flitted through Takkarram's mind fighting for attention, and in a separate region of his brain, even several emotions were in a stuggle of their own to bubble up on top.  

At last it was shame that won. 

Takkarram felt a bit ashamed that this tiny creature has not only grasped his predicament, but is also offering a solution, and it looked like he is quite capable of carrying it out to its logical end. And as shame made way, his heart was filled with admiration. He then said with a bit more softness in his voice than before, 'I don't want any help. Why were you listening to our conversation in the first place?'.

'Sir, I came to sell the peanuts.', beckoning to his basket, 'I tried to grab your attention several times discreetly by walking in between you both, but you did not notice. I felt there was some tension in the situation. I thought I'll wait for the tension to subside a bit and  then ask you to buy peanuts. So, I settled beside you waiting for the right moment.'

'You didn't seem like you were waiting. You were hiding behind the mound of grass.'

'Sir, it was the mound you created, there was nothing when I started waiting.'.

Takkarram gave a start as if his Rajdoot kick lever rebounded. He winced a little, and may have silently bitten his teeth,  and said, 'Okay, so you want to sell the peanuts, is that right?'.

Chikka nodded in the affirmative. He was glad that this transaction seemed like it's going towards fruitful conclusion.

He looked at the basket and was taken aback by the revolting looking pieces that he was expected to buy.

Chikka being quite accustomed to this reaction from his would-be buyers, was ready with his weapon and he was keen to deploy his arsenal.

He has realised at at very young age that there's a strange power in his eyes. Any marketing department of a thriving charity concern would pick him up instantly for their commercials. If commercials is the right word, or should I say an ad. Commercial has a pretty uncharitable financial sense to it.
Let's settle with ad. I'm referring to those that suddenly jump on you out of nowhere when you are cosily watching your favorite serial or a match. Here you are in your happy little world, having pleasant time, and then you are confronted with a pair of haunting eyes, the accompanying booming voice making you feel like a cold hearted person that has no right to the comforts you are having unless you donate sizable portion of your funds to the organisation that is doing all it can to save all those that possess such haunting eyes.

Chikka started turning the dial on his eyes such that the very eyes that were sparkling with naughtiness at his customers inability to speak to his beloved, suddenly took a turn to look a bit haunting as if he has not had food the whole day.

Takkaram felt compelled to react. He said, 'but, but, look at those ghastly things you call peanuts. God knows what you mixed in them. I don't like their color. They remind me of the, the..'

'Sir, I are you saying the goat droppings?'

'I was thinking of something else, but yes, your description suits it better', Takkarram said, with questioning look on his face as if to ask if they are actually that.

Chikka exploded into a laughing fit. It's remarkable quickly his emotions change. His laugh was a series of halts and explosions of noises that could well have come out of an excited, smaller than usual pony, that started out being a donkey, but at the last moment shifted course to become a pony. This was accompanied by his slapping his right thigh with his hand as if to control himself.

When he recovered, he said, 'Sir, everybody says that. But why would I carry goat droppings?'

'I don't know, you tell me.', Takkarram couldn't help asking.

'No, sir, I just put lots of black masala on them. You'll know when you eat them.'

Takkarram didn't seem convinced. He also didn't seem like he relished the opportunity. But, he knew that the little devil will not move without selling those sickly goat dropping like things. Also, from the corner of his eye, he could notice a certain softening of Andagamma's eyes, as she no doubt, began finding this little exchange amusing. So, he wanted to finish this business with Chikka, and get back to wooing Andagamma.

'OK. Give me one packet.'

Chikka looked at him as if to say, I did all this for you just for one packet and then he turned gaze towards Andagamma for some support. Andagamma promptly gave Takkarram a reproachful look.

Takkarram already being tortured by Andagamma's angry looks, did want one more emotion added to them.
