# The Irani Chai  [WIP]

Status : Still Cooking

If you wake up Takkaram Kirrakke in the middle of the night and give him  two choices that he can have irani chai for the rest of his life or every other food item imaginable, he would pick irani chai every time without batting an eyelid.

He has dipped his tongue in this ambrosial liquid at all of the venerable places in Dyrabad that have practiced  this craft for god knows how long. 
If you look at these places you might come out thinking that these places haven't been cleaned for that long as well. 
It's as if the staff at these places just make tea or serve tea, they don't have any staff to clean the place. 
Why would they? 
The staff they have are already working at phenomenal speeds and yet are barely keeping up with the regular demand from the inhabitants of Dyrabad.
