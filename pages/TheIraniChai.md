# The Irani Chai

If you wake up Takkaram Kirrakke in the middle of the night and give him  two choices that he can have irani chai for the rest of his life or every other food item imaginable, he would pick irani chai every time without batting an eyelid.

He has dipped his tongue in this ambrosial liquid at all of the venerable places in Dyrabad that have practiced  this craft for god knows how long.
