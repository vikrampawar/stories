# The Double Decker bus (Original 2014)

Standing at the bus stop at Patny centre, Secunderabad, my eyes were on the busy jostling crowd falling over each other to get onto buses filled to the last inch.

The buses, mostly double-deckers, were moving slowly and surely, but unwillingly, like a pregnant woman as the passengers were latching onto any firm piece of the bus they could latch onto and hanging onto it. 

Some of the weaker people were giving up their struggle to get onto the bus, as the more energetic ones pushed them aside to make room for their foot on the platform of the bus. 

That was enough for them to slowly wriggle themselves into comfortable position as the bus moved on. 

But, my attention was not on the buses or on the crowd, or on the acrobatics of the energetic bullies, or even on the obnoxious smoke coming out of the buses, it was focused on how that day went, how that year went, and how the year before that went.
