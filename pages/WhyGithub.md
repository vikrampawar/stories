## Why Github

This is not really a story but may satisfy any curiosity the reader may be having on the author's chosen way to distribute his work.

A reader flowing with the milk of human kindness may think that, although the reader has found this Github repository, and is glad that it has satisfied some primeval urges that lay dormant somewhere in the deep trenches within the reader's human form, the reader is nevertheless worried that it may be hard to find for fellow brethren who may also be oozing with the milk of human kindness, but may be not quite in the same copious amounts that the reader is oozing.

The author understands the reader's concern.
He is glad that chivalry isn't dead.
Decency and concern for the fellow human being is still alive and well in the hearts of, if not all, or most, at least some of the general population.

However, the author hastens to allay the fears of the reader.
However genuine the fears are, the author is glad to say that they are misplaced.

The author has in the past tried other mechanisms that outwardly seem superior. 
Where such mechanisms included what the young of flesh would classify under the broad term 'social media'.

The author does not deny that this modern miracle of the giant cauldron of human emotional exchanges has its unquestionable benefits.
But, he has keenly observed that it also has some rather nasty effect on the emotions of those that are not made of the heart of steel.

For those with such said hearts of steel, all this talk of nasty effects may seem too fluffy.
The author is only too aware of these tendencies of the sons (or daughters) of soil with steel hearts, as he himself goes through phases where his own heart turns into steel in which form it remains for some uncertain period and then relapses into its usual form of some rather overcooked mushy peas.

The author being well aware of his own tendencies, now that he is in, if not fairly advanced, certainly advanced enough, years to know himself as well as he is ever going to know himself, has chosen a, what he thinks, is a wise course of action.

He has determined for himself, his reason to write.
It warms the cockles of his heart that there are readers with golden hearts that like to hang by every word the author writes.
However, when he mixed his lot into the giant cauldron in the past, he had sometimes mistaken the random ephemeral workings of the mysterious algorithms to be pronouncements of the unquestionable judgments of those very readers.
This in spite of the fact that the author is also a slinger of variables and functions.
And therefore, as one would assume, is more than aware of how the mysterious algorithms are heartless, if such mental figments can be said to have hearts in the first place.

Now knowing enough about the workings of the human heart, especially his own, he has decided not to subject it with anymore of the undue stresses than which its fair quota demands.

He has taken the prudent action of keeping as much of a distance from the immediate feedback from the readers as is possible - both in time and space - while at the same, time making it easy for the right reader to find what the reader wishes to read.
