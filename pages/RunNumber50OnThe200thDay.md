# Run number 50 on the 200th Day (Original 2014)

As I was tying the fluorescent lace of my grey Karrimor shoes  (80% discount, sasta aur khifayati!) this morning with two flights of stairs separating me from pressing the run button on the red Nike app to start my run number 50,  several thoughts in my mind were fighting each other ferociously for the top spot. And quickly deciding it was unwise, they gave up and declared themselves joint winners. So, I was left with this mixed emotions. 

To get an idea of the emotions, think of Roger Federer walking down the pavilion towards the court to play Nadal in the Wimbledon Finals. Think of all the attention and anticipation, the cheering of the crowd, the shouting of the commentators, the clicking of the photographers, and the shooting of the videographers, think of what must be going through Roger's mind, the agony of the wait to go to the court, the excitement of the thought of the win, the nerves. Did you get the picture? Good. I wasn't going through any of those emotions, I wasn't playing Nadal in the Wimbledon finals after all. 

I came down and pressed the run button with some extra excitement than usual and started my run - or a gentle jog if you have to be precise. As I was half way up the zebra crossing near the house, a van driver in murderous mood drove quickly past me, I leapt clunkily with all my might into safety thinking  that was a close save (Jaan bachi to laakho paye) very unlike Federer who would have thought 'Is that all you've got Mr Nadal, bring it on'. 

I got into a pleasant running rhythm. The first mile came without any further incidents and as the smooth voice told me that it was in 11 minutes, at least 2 minutes faster than the usual and that too without trying, few tingles ran pleasantly down through my spine.

In a few minutes, I was out of the Greenwich park and into the Greenwich town centre;  passed by small cute shops, a bookshop (see picture), and a young chinese runner running wildly in the opposite direction. Smiling to myself, I came to a road crossing and found a stationary van on the road. The previous van incident fresh on my mind, I turned to run behind the van, when the van driver smiling profusely beckoned  me to go from the front. I smiled back and crossed the road running in front of the van. [Federer would have thought Nadal has given up by this time, and go for the kill] . By then the sweet voice said it was two miles, so I headed back home.

Back into the Greenwich park, panting my way up the steep slope of the 'The Avenue',  I noticed the young chinese runner again, running wildly as before and may be with a dash of passion more this time, and was admiring her stamina in maintaining that pace for so long when the sweet voice told me that it was three miles. The tingles that ran earlier down the spine, ran a lot more copiously this time with the realization that I've done the 50th run, even if I have to crawl back home from here. 

In this happy frame of mind I reached the narrow gate of the park, when I uttered  a 'Ooooouuuuuuuuu' sound to my own utter amazement. After a fraction of a second of confusion, it dawned on me the reason for that utterance - two alsatian dogs tried to get in through the narrow opening at the same time as I was going out, nearly bumping into me. I don't remember when I was as startled as this. [Federer would have thought, Nadal hasn't given up yet]. In the remaining fraction of the second, a lady emerged holding the other end of the two leads that ran to the dogs.  Realizing what happened, she apologized profusely. Saying 'it's ok', I ran back the remaining distance home with no further incidents.

When I pressed the end button on the Nike app which showed me that it was the 50th run, and the the distance was 4.15 miles, profound peace engulfed me.
