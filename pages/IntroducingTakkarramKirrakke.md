# Introducing Takkarram Kirrakke

I, Takkarram Kirrakke, am a figment of the author's imagination.

If you ask the author, he - yes a he - he would say all the expected good things you'd want to hear from him.

But, I think I know why he created me.

He always has grandiose visions of the future.
Some sinister of the heart might even say delusions.
He thinks he would be world renowned one day and wants to take steps now to make sure that some black hearted person would not make his life difficult for him then for not having taken these careful steps now. 
If you are anything like the cognoscenti that I happen to hobnob with, no doubt you are saying something like 'world renowned, my ass', 'careful steps - my foot' or something along those lines to yourself.
And, I'd sympathize with your sentiment.

But now, you can begin to see why he created me.
It is precisely these kinds of reactions from the cognoscenti that he wants directed towards me, Takkarram Kirrakke, and not he, the author.
Although the author has high regard for his readers, he nevertheless knows that there may be a small percentage of readers, who are , for the lack of a better phrase, 'slow on the uptake'. 

Although they may harbour no ill intentions, they might assume whatever the author has written has taken place, or that when the author says I, he means I, the author. 

If that was the case, it would shackle the author to a very small range of the realms of possibilities.
So, to make it easy for the reader to picture somebody else and not him, he has created me.

So if you see him say 'I', know that he usually means 'me', here 'me' refers to me which you of course know am I.
Just to clarify any doubts, so that we have everybody onboard, here when I said I, I meant me, Takkarram Kirrakke.

If you are concerned about the the profusion of 'k's and 'r's in my name, it is his attempt to make my name unique. 
So unique, that there's only one of me.
You might say, 'unique' normally implies precisely that, and you might even end it with 'you ass'.
But you know, it never hearts to be careful.
To elaborate on points that most think doesn't need any elaboration.

I'm diverting from the topic.
When you say my name, you have to roll the 'r's.
If you do not roll the 'r', it is not my name.
For all the good things things we can say about an English speaker, there is a weakness the e.s possesses that the author knows only too keenly about.
That when confronted with an 'r' that has to be rolled, he looks at it askance.
He deliberates.
He dilly-dallys.
And when he gathers the courage, he rolls one 'r'.
If he is in a particularly effervescent mood, he might even roll another 'r'.
There is yet another weakness that he possesses, that he may not even know about.
That is his blissful ignorance to the existence of the soft 'k'.

As we have established the peculiar weaknesses of the English speaker, you can now know his reaction when he has to face the prospect of uttering my name.
Even the most ardent among them would go round the issue.
I mean they'll walk around it.
They'll look at both the first name and the surname.
They'll look at the surname and then the first name.
They'll say to themselves, let me try the first name, or the surname as the case may be.
They are sure that saying both at the same time will require the proficiencies that they are sure they will never even attempt to build.  
We cannot rule out the fact that there may be some individual peculiarities within the speakers which makes them markedly more proficient at the syllables that appear in the first name or the surname as the case may be.
After so choosing, they might begin working on the first of the 'r's and they might get over it.
And after a bit more of effort, they might even successfully negotiate the second 'r'.
But, they've left the soft 'k's.
So, the utterance, however laboured, doesn't resemble anything like my first name or the surname.
If I'm lucky, I might make out that the sounds that were produced after all the facial contortions was their best attempt at uttering my first name or the surname.
Sometimes it is hard to establish if it was the first name or the surname.
Indeed, I would not know that it was me they were referring to if I was not the direct witness of the indescribable forms their faces were assuming before the sound emanated from it.

So it is safe to assume that no English speaker would bear such a name. Note that here I meant bear in one sense and not the other, also I meant bear not bare, although, if I did interchange, the difference would be too subtle to escape even the finest combers of the strands of the English language.

Now it must be clear as a crystal that it's a fictional name and the possibility that anybody would bear that name is so remote as to be considered nonexistent.





However, if is faced with a battery of 'r', soft 'k's,
