# Introducing Takkarram Kirrakke

I, Takkarram Kirrakke, am a figment of the author's imagination.

If you ask the author, he - yes a he - he would say all the expected good things you'd want to hear from him.

But, I think I know why he created me.

He always has grandiose visions of the future.
He thinks he would be world renowned one day and wants to take steps now to make sure that some black hearted person would not make his life difficult for him then for not having taken these careful steps now. 
If you are anything like the cognoscenti that I happen to be hobnob with, no doubt you are saying something like 'world renowned, my ass', 'careful steps - my foot' or something along those lines to yourself.
And, I'd sympathize with your sentiment.

But now, you can begin to see why he created me.
It is precisely these kinds of reactions from the cognoscenti that he wants directed towards me, Takkarram Kirrakke, and not he, the author.
Although the author has high regard for his readers, he nevertheless knows that there may be a small percentage of readers, who are , for the lack of better phrase, 'slow on the uptake'. 

Although they may harbour no ill intentions, they might assume whatever the author has written has taken place, or that when the author says I, he indeed means I, the author. 

If that was the case, it would shackle the author to a very small range of the realms of possibilities.
So, to make it easy for the reader to picture somebody else and not him, he has created me.

So if you see him say 'I', know that he usually means 'me', here 'me' refers to me which you of course know am I.
Just to clarify any doubts, so that we have everybody onboard, here when I said I, I meant me, Takkarram Kirrakke.
