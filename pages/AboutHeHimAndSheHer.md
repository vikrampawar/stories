## About He/Him, She/Her

The author hasn't yet formed a clear view of how he wants to handle this pesky problem of assuming the reader to be of a certain gender.

He is keenly aware that it makes it a lot easier to read and write to assume that the reader is of one gender.

However he is also one that is sensitive enough to understand the gravity of the problem.
He does not think it fair to assume by default that the reader is male.

For now, he has taken the approach that he is proceeding to elaborate.
If in writing, it makes it easy to assume one gender, he will assume it to be male in circumstances that the said person is shown in dubious light.
And in circumstances where the said person is being shown in a shining light, he will assume it to be the gender of the gentler sex.  

There may be some instances where the author may forget to do this.
The reader should rest assured, the reason is the infirmity of the author's mind, and not that of his heart which bears no malice.
