# Introducing Tangavelu Sombulingam Eliot (Original 2014)

When God (Brahma, the four-headed one to be precise) began making Tangavelu Sombulingam Eliot, he was in a particularly jovial mood. And when he is in that mood, he tends to make his best work. He began by making an exquisite set of shining white teeth, and an extra long unmentionable and was marvelling at his work, when, Saraswati, his consort,  having got really bored playing astachamma (Ludo) all by her own, came to Brahma for some masti (timepass/entertainment). 

She saw one of the heads pretty engrossed in making a human being, so she carefully went behind him and started playing with the mustache of the fourth head, the one on the back. Although the first head could not see this, it felt uncomfortable, and Brahma lost his concentration. But duty-bound, he nevertheless finished the rest of his masterpiece quickly before he turned around to find the cause of his discomfort. And because he finished him in such a hurry, and carelessness, the rest of T.S.Eliot's features were in stark contrast to his other redeeming features mentioned above, namely, shining white teeth and the extra long unmentionable.

That was not the only time in his life, Tangavelu Sombulingam Eliot  was shortchanged because of the playfulness of a woman. However, the two compensating features Brahma gave him were going to take him take him a long, long way.
