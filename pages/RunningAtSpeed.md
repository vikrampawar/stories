# Running at speed

If you are a runner yourself, or a keen or even curious observer, you'd have also noticed that I run about 3 miles, and run them extremely slowly - I average about 12-13 minutes per mile. This is usually the speed even when I don't stop at all for the whole duration. 

 My intention has been to run about 3 miles in 30 minutes everyday. That seemed like the perfect thing to do. It hit all the right notes - natural exercise, 30 minutes, outdoors in the park, profuse sweating, rhythmic. But, as it's going to be daily, I took a conscious decision to keep my running as safe as possible. So, I run, or jog at the most comfortable speed.

I got so used to running now, that I don't feel the instant exhilaration I felt on each of the 7 occasions I ran in my entire life prior to my current running frenzy. So, at a nice stretch of road in Royal Greenwich park, I suddenly decided to run as fast as I could. I ran for a few hundred meters, and when I could no longer sustain that pace, I got back to my regular slow steady rhythm. Although, my overall time hasn't improved much - it's 11:23 per mile today - , I felt the exhilaration that one expects from a run. It was nice to know that I could run that fast, and also had muscles at so many places in the body that could work in unison to propel me forward. These muscles may never have worked together so hard for such a duration, ever in life!

Obviously after such an event, there is always a pleasant hang-over. It reminded me, that I always had this desire to do things as fast as I could. The faster I could do, the better I felt. May be, because of which, I went through a painful month of re-learning typing, and touch type instead of hunt and peck, at the age of 27, in the midst of a stressful job that demanded reasonable typing speed.

So, I felt the urge to challenge myself to write as much as I can in [25 minutes](OnPomodoro.md). I did so, and it proved to be as exhilarating an experience as the sprint in the morning, although I didn't sweat as much. I wrote 1010 words (don't worry you are not reading them right now). I didn't write anything profound or intelligent - it was mostly recounting of what happened in the last few months that came to my mind -  nevertheless, it was quite enjoyable, a remarkable contrast to the feelings I get when I write these one-a-day posts, carefully, and cautiously. One pleasant side-effect was that the daily post also came quickly - about 500 words in a pomodoro. 

Speed indeed has it's advantages, if it's used with discretion.
